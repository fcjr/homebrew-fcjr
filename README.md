# Fcjr's Homebrew Tap

This is my personal tap for my various cli tools.

## Supported formulae

- None! (Formulae coming soon!)

## How do I install these formulae?

Simply run:

    brew install fcjr/fcjr/<formula>

Alternatively:
1) Add the entire tap via `brew tap fcjr/fcjr`
2) Then install a formula via `brew install <formula>`

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
